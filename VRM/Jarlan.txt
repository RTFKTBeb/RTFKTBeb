Jarlan.vrm - Untouched Transforms. This will break in the VRM Model in OnCyber. You must zero out the transforms before export.
Jarlan2.vrm - Zeroed Transforms. This will work in OnCyber but the model is small.
Jarlan3.vrm - 1.5x Scale. This seems like the average height.
Jarlan4.vrm - 2x Scale. Seems Tall.
Jarlan5.vrm - 3x on (X) & 2x on (Y/Z) in attempt to address the skinny issue on OnCyber. Failed. Really Bad.
